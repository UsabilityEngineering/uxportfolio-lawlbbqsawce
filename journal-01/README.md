<p>When we live in a world as interconnected as ours, it is more challenging and more important than ever to use truly secure passwords. Unfortunately the vast majority of us make memorable passwords, re-use passwords, or just alter our existing ones. Ideal passwords would simply be long strings of random characters, if anyone could remember one for even a day. While passwords are supposed to be known only by us, they are not designed to be <strong>memorable</strong>. If they were, we could easily remember every password we make. To be fair, though, some people do remember all of their passwords. I know this because I am one such person, but for a different reason than I used to be. I used to know all of my passwords because they were very similar and highly <strong>memorable</strong>. If the wrong account got breached, they all got breached. That is, until I started using a password manager.</p>
<p>Today I know all of my passwords in the sense that I know my password manager's password, and it knows all my other passwords. Whenever I need a new password, it generates one for me and saves the credentials. Before I got to where I am today, I started with a Google search. I searched for "LastPass Linux" in the hopes I could bring security to this open-source platform.</p>

<p>Just then fortune smiled, and I entered LastPass.com in my quest for a download link. So far it had been actions I’d already known and there was a comfort to that. This new site gave me a clear path to download LastPass, using some bright colors and large font to direct me.</p>

<p>It was by following that path that I stumbled across my first challenge, installation instructions.</p>

<p>This page suddenly looked empty and devoid of cues or clues, save a splash of blue near the center of the screen. It was a simple download link, followed by supposedly simple and learnable instructions. Learnable in this case would be easy to pick up or understand, as it were… or wasn’t. Entering commands into a computer is not difficult by itself, but these commands actually have meaning and mechanics per letter in many cases. They are very error tolerant however, as they will only look for a specific file and do not do anything until it is located. This means the programs will not do anything to the computer except for what it is supposed to.</p>

<p>Once LastPass’ software components were installed, a web page opened to allow sign-up for a LastPass account.</p>

<p>Creating an account was straightforward and highly learnable, requiring only an active email. I entered my email and my desired master password, making sure to use over 12 characters, then signed up. I confirmed my email via phone and was ready to go!</p>

<p>Or I would’ve been, but I lacked some truly secure passwords. Very fortunately, LastPass offers the option to generate a password for me. This is indicated in the extension’s dropdown menu, and offers a wide range of password generation customization options.</p>

<p>Once I had a password I was satisfied with, it was off to my LastPass vault, where a large plus had me thinking I could add a new entry. I’d remembered the action from other software and figured it would apply here too. Shortly after clicking the button, a new screen popped up with some fields for basic account information. I entered away, saved my fine password, and my quest was over.</p>
