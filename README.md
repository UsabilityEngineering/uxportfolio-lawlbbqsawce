# UX Portfolio
Hi,

My name is Kira Casto and I am a 24 year old Computer Information Systems major. I live and work here in Chico, while taking full time classes.

I enrolled in Usability Engineering so I could learn more about why some things just feel better to use. I'm hoping I can improve the UX of my habits if nothing else!
