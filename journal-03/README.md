<p>In the past few months, the world has found itself with a sudden need for digital communication solutions. With daily life all but halted by a global pandemic, there is now a clear demand for high quality digital tools. For the purposes of this analysis, a high quality tool is one which allows consistent connections, voice/video/text communication without instruction, and no readily exploitable security vulnerabilities. The consistent connection will help determine how readily <strong>UX Efficiency</strong> goals are met, as an inefficient system will experience significant slowdown. A tool with a variety of reliable communication methods will influence <strong>UX Learnability, Memorability, and Effectiveness</strong> performance, as these methods can make the difference when seeking to communicate with an entire group. Of course all of these features can be compromised if the tool does not have sufficient <strong>Error Tolerance</strong>, so the tool must have no readily exploitable security vulnerabilities and must employ safegaurds to reduce risk exposure to user error.</p>
